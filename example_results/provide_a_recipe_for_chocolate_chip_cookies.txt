**Ingredients:**

* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup granulated sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips

**Instructions:**

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.


2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.


3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and vanilla extract until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes.


4. Gradually add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each.


5. Gradually mix in the dry ingredients until just combined.


6. Fold in the chocolate chips.


7. Using a rounded tablespoon, drop heaping tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.


8. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown and the centers are slightly soft.


9. Let cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

**Tips:**

* For chewier cookies, chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking.
* For larger cookies, use 3 tablespoons of dough per cookie.
* Add in other mix-ins like chopped nuts, oatmeal, or dried fruit.

These cookies are sure to be a hit at your gathering!
